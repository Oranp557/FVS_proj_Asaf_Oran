For part 2 use rev6 with automation. You need to change the path of the NuXmv.exe path to match it in your computer. Also chage the output durectory of the files in the main part of the python -> output log of our project is in full_output.txt
Run command: python <path>/main_rev6_with_nusmv_automation.py > output_log.txt 2>&1

for part 3 use the rev6 automation with comp egine. Also here change the paths as above and set a different output file we used full_output_part3.txt
for part 4b use rev6 with iterative solver - we added some level sokoban there (level 6) but any board could be added there.

In general in the python you can change the bound number k and the egine bdd or sat.
